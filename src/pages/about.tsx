          Hi, I'm Aurora Wang, a self-taught Frontend Developer with a passion for creating responsive and user-friendly web applications. My journey into tech started in December 2024 when I decided to dive deep into the world of web development.
        </p>

        <p>
          ðŸ“š <strong>Learning Journey:</strong> I began my self-taught journey through online platforms like Udemy, YouTube, and other resources. Initially, I focused on mastering the fundamentalsâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I progressed, I moved on to more advanced topics like React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript and modern front-end tools to build real-world projects.Additionally, I have also learned some basic back-end technologies, such as Node.js and Express.js, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of full-stack development.
        </p>

        <p>
          ðŸ’» <strong>Hands-On Projects:</strong> Throughout my learning, I worked on multiple personal projects to solidify my skills, ranging from static websites to dynamic applications. These projects gave me valuable experience in frontend development, and I continue to build on them as I learn more.
